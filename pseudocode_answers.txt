###Short Answer

1. Programmers use pseudocode to logically break down what the code will be doing that humans can understand and not computers.
2. The code would result in an error since pseudocode is meant for humans and not computers.


###Programming Assignment

1. "Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number."

Input first number
Input second number
IF the first number is greater than the second number THEN
  PRINT first number
ELSE
  PRINT second number
ENDIF

2. "Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100."

SET max to 100
SET number to 1
WHILE the number is not equal to max
  PRINT number
  ADD 1 to number
ENDWHILE
   
3. "Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook."

INIT Phonebook array
INPUT entry
FOR each entry in the array
  IF current iteration of phonebook array is equal to entry
    return current iteration of phonebook
  ELSE 
    PRINT no results
  ENDIF
ENDFOR
   
4. "Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice."

var phonebook = ["One", "Two", "Three"]
var entry = "Two"
for (i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++) {
  if (phonebook[i] == entry){
    return phonebook[i];
  }
}
  return('no results');
