2. One company that used an algorithm to succeed in business was BBVA. Using their customer's data to create algorithms that
give their customers the best ways to invest and also give them more services to choose from by implement algorithms
to better serve their customers. Another company was McDonalds that uses an algorithm to pretty much guarantee that 
the service and food would be the same no matter which store you went. Amazon uses an algorithm to make sure they ship
the most efficient way possible while also keeping their prime customers having 2 day guaranteed shipping.

3. An algorithm that is more efficient does the same if not better quality in term of code as an inefficent one but
does it in the shortest amount of time possible or in a shorter time than an inefficient one.
